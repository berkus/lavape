Release notes for lavape-0.9.0
==============================

Installation of Lava/LavaPE
===========================


How to install the binary release of LavaPE on Windows
======================================================

Simply launch the downloaded lavape-<rel>-win32-bin.exe file and
follow the instructions of the installer.


How to install the LavaPE binary release for Linux
==================================================

Download the compressed tar file of the
LavaPE source distribution and store it
in the parent directory of the envisaged
lavape installation directory.

Uncompress it using the command

   tar xjvf lavape-<release>-linux-bin.tar.bz2

or, if your UNIX-tar command doesn't support
the "j" option:

   bunzip2 lavape-<release>-linux-bin.tar.bz2
   tar xf lavape-<release>-linux-bin.tar

Then just execute the install script:

   cd lavape
   ./install

This script generates two program launch scripts
"lavape" and "lava" in lavape/bin which you can use
then to launch the Lava Programming Environment or
the Lava Interpreter.


How to install LavaPE from the source distribution on UNIX
==========================================================

Download the compressed tar file of the
LavaPE source distribution and store it
in the parent directory of the envisaged
lavape installation directory.

Uncompress it using the command

   tar xjvf lavape-<release>-src.tar.bz2

or, if your UNIX-tar command doesn't support
the "j" option:

   bunzip2 lavape-<release>-src.tar.bz2
   tar xf lavape-<release>-src.tar

Read lavape/INSTALL.txt for the details
and pre-requisites of a successfull
installation. (In particular, you need
to have GNU gcc/make and the developer version
of TrollTech/Qt4.

Qt-4.1.4 is OK, Qt-4.2.0 contains a bug
that prevents Lava from working properly. GIF support
is required (configure option -qt-gif), or else you won't
be able to see the gif images contained in the Lava
online help.

If Qt isn't installed in /usr/lib/qt you have to
provide an environment variable QTDIR that points
to the Qt4 installation directory. (Alternatively
you may also make /usr/lib/qt a symbolic link
that points to the Qt4 installation directory.)

Then build the LavaPE executables as follows:

   cd lavape
   make

This will take quite a while.
You will find the executables
of the Lava Programming Environment
in lavape/bin thereafter:
"LavaPE", "Lava", and "LPC".
(The Lava Precompiler "LPC" is needed
only during the build process.)

Launch "LavaPE", consult the Online Help,
open some sample programs from the
lavape/samples directory and enjoy the
unique structure editing features of LavaPE.

We'd appreciate very much if you would inform
us (e-mail: guenthk@users.sourceforge.net)
about any problems that you have encounterd
during the installation or while using
Lava/LavaPE.

But let us also know if you could successfully
install and use LavaPE. So far, we could not test Lava
on all platforms where we can build it successfully.


How to build Lava/LavaPE on Windows from the source tarball
===========================================================

Currently this requires that you have installed either
the MinGW/MSYS software (see www.mingw.org) and the official
OpenSource version of TrollTech's Qt4 for Windows, or the free
MS VC++ 2005 Express IDE and the modified, unofficial
OpenSource version of TrollTech's Qt4 for Windows.

Windows/MinGW:
=============

TrollTech offers a Qt 4 download package that also installs
MinGW, or you can download and install MinGW separately
from www.mingw.org and download the pure Qt4 version without
MinGW.

Unpack Qt4, set the environment variable QTDIR=
<Qt4 install directory> and set environment
variable QMAKESPEC=win32-g++. Add %QTDIR%\bin to your PATH
environment variable.

(Qt-4.1.4 is OK, Qt-4.2.0 contains a bug
that prevents Lava from working properly. GIF support
is required (configure option -qt-gif), or else you won't
be able to see the gif images contained in the Lava
online help.)

Then open a DOS command window, cd to the Qt4 install
directory and execute
   configure -qt-gif
and, after successful configuration, the 
   nmake
command.

(Hint: During the Qt4 build process the MSYS and cygwin
bin directories should not be in your PATH.)

Unpack the Lava source package lavape-<release>-src.tar.bz2
to a directory of your choice. Add the MSYS\1.0\bin
directory to your PATH. Then open the MSYS command
window. Cd to the Lava install directory and execute
a "mingw32-make" command. This will build the entire
Lava software and install the LavaPE.exe and Lava.exe
executables in the lavape/bin directory.

(Further remarks as in the Linux case.)

Windows/VC++ 2005 Express:
=========================

Get the Qt4 OpenSource version for Windows from TrollTech
and VC++ 2005 Express from Microsoft. Install VC++.

(Qt-4.1.4 is OK, Qt-4.2.0 contains a bug
that prevents Lava from working properly. GIF support
is required (qconfigure option -qt-gif), or else you won't
be able to see the gif images contained in the Lava
online help.)

Unpack Qt4 to a directory of your choice. Set QTDIR
and PATH as in the MinGW case.
QMAKESPEC need not be defined.

Get the "Unofficial patches for Qt4" from the Q../Free
project at SourceForge (formerly qt-win):

  https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49109

Unpack the contents of this zip file to the Qt4 install
directory.

Install also the Microsoft Platform SDK (the core  + internet
components suffice) as described by the Q../Free project.

Modify the VC\VCProjectDefaults\corewin_express.vsprops file
of VS 2005 as described by the Q../Free project.

Launch VC++ and open the "Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt"
window from the "Tools" menu of VC++.

Execute the "installpatch..." script.

Execute "qconfigure msvc2005 -qt-gif". This will completely
install the "unofficial" Qt4-VC++ version.

Open "Tools"-->"Options..." in VC++, select "Projects and Solutions"
--> "VC++ directories"--> "Include files". Add the primary
Qt include directories

$(QTDIR)\Include
$(QTDIR)\Include\QtCore
$(QTDIR)\Include\QtGui
$(QTDIR)\Include\QtNetwork

and similarly for the library files.

Open the "LavaPE.sln" file from the lavape\src directory
in VC++. Execute "Build solution" from the "Build" menu.

This will build the Lava software and install the Lava
executables in the <lavape>\bin directory.
