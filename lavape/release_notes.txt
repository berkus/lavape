Release notes for lavape-0.9
============================

Migration to Qt4:
================

In a big effort, the entire Lava software has been
migrated to Trolltech's Qt4 package; all dependencies
on Qt3 have been removed.

Checking optional-to-mandatory assignments:
==========================================

As a further step towards complete variable
initialization checks LavaPE now enforces already
at programming time that optional variables and
expressions have a non-null value if the latter is
assigned to a mandatory variable.

The new LavaPE release accepts such an assignment
only

a) if the source of the assignment is an (optional)
variable that is checked by an "ifdef" conditional
statement and if the assigment is contained in the
"then" clause of the "ifdef" statement, or

b) if the source of the assignment is an "else"
expression "x else y" where at least one of x or y
is mandatory.

"x else y" checks (at run time) whether x is null;
if yes then the "else" expression yields y, if no then the
expression yields x.
