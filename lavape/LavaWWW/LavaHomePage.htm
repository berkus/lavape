    <p>The demand for new software grows continuously. Existing software has to
      be changed and adapted to new requirements in ever shorter intervals. On
      the other hand, the possibilities to recruit foreign programmers or to
      increase the number of qualified domestic programmers are limited. Rather,
      we shall be able to cope with this challenge only</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" id="Grafik4" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14580_.png" />
      if the productivity (or simply: the speed) of the programming process</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" id="Grafik5" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14580_.png" />
      and if program quality, comprehensibility, and, as a consequence, program
      maintainability</p>
    <p>can be decisively improved.</p>
    <p>This means that we cannot stay with the presently popular programming
      languages like <span class="plname">Java</span> and <span class="plname">Visual
        Basic</span>. We have to aim for greatly improved programming languages
      and <span class="plname">RAD</span> programming environments that fulfill
      the following requirements:</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They relieve programmers from <a href="doc/html/PointAndClick.htm">clerical
        and error-prone work</a>, and in particular:</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      they replace text-editing with <a href="doc/html/StructEdAdvant.htm">structure-editing</a>
      throughout the program development process.</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They prevent or detect errors already at programming time wherever
      possible, for instance the omnipresent dangers</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>of missing variable initialization caused by the absence of a <a href="doc/html/IniChecks.htm">stringent
            object initialization discipline</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>of "dangling" pointers caused by erroneous manual <a href="doc/html/PointersRefCounts.htm">storage
            allocation and de-allocation</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>and of mismatching data types caused by erroneous "<a href="doc/html/Unsolved.htm#typeCasts">type
            casts</a>".</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They are easy to learn and get along with a minimum number of orthogonal
      concepts.</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They support Lego-like composition and <a href="doc/html/Refactoring.htm">restructuring/refactoring
        of programs</a>.</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They allow us to compose programs from <a href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm#smallFunctions">small
        functions</a> and <a href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm#smallInterfaces">classes</a>
      that can be understood by themselves</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      and decisively <a href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm">facilitate program
        comprehension</a> in this way.</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They support <a href="doc/html/OOanalysis.htm">smooth incremental
        transition</a> from OO analysis to OO design and implementation.</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They unify what should not be separated ("<a href="doc/html/DatabaseIntegration.htm">embedded
        SQL</a>")</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      and separate what should not be intermingled ("<a href="doc/html/SepItfImpl.htm">interfaces
        and implementations</a>").</p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      They facilitate reuse of certified <a href="doc/html/Components.htm">components</a>
      and proven <a href="doc/html/PatternSamples.htm">design patterns</a> <a
        target="_blank"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">*)</a>
    </p>
    <p><img width="12" height="12" alt="img" src="doc/images/BD14868_1.png" />
      from clearly documented component libraries,<a href="doc/html/OOanalysis.htm#patternLanguage">pattern
        libraries and pattern languages</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.designmatrix.com/pl/anatomy.html">*)</a>.</p>
    <p>The productivity of the software development process will be increased
      considerably in this way, and the costs of software maintenance and
      continuous adaptation to changing requirements will be reduced decisively.</p>
    <p>The experimental programming language <span class="plname">Lava</span>
      and the associated <span class="plname">LavaPE</span> programming
      environment are based on a <a href="doc/html/Unsolved.htm">systematic
        analysis</a> of all those problems that currently impair the simplicity
      of languages and tools and that in this way obstruct the productivity of
      programmers, and they offer solutions to quite a number of these problems.</p>
    <p>The overall approach of the <span class="plname">Lava/LavaPE</span>project
is
      to combine an uncompromising point-and-click programming style with a more
      consistent, largely simplified and unified object-, component-, and
      pattern-oriented conceptual framework.</p>
    <p>A particularly attractive feature of <span class="plname">LavaPE</span>
      is that it is perfectly <strong>point-and-click</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>no text entry is required, neither for declarations nor for
          executable code (except for comments, constants, and new identifiers);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>no syntax learning, no syntactic errors, many other formal errors are
          prevented, likewise, or are reported immediately at the moment when
          they arise during program editing. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Renaming / rearrangement operations on <span class="plname">Lava</span>
          declarations entail automatic updates of all existing references: <a
            target="_blank"
            href="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring
            support</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/refactoring/info">*)</a>
          is already provided by the basic <span class="plname">LavaPE</span>
          structure editors.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These and many other features make <span class="plname">Lava</span>
      particularly suited also for teaching object-oriented programming (and, to
      some extent, also <a href="doc/html/OOanalysis.htm">OO analysis and
        design</a>).</p>
    <p>However, <span class="plname">Lava</span> isn't just the easy way of
      programming. According to the motto <strong>less syntax, more semantics</strong>
      <span class="plname">Lava</span> attempts to shift the programmer's
      attention and efforts away from the meticulous observance of complex
      syntactic rules towards a higher degree of "structured programming" and <a
        href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm">program
        comprehensibility</a>. As a natural consequence, this requires also a
      higher degree of discipline, more conscious consideration, and it also
      involves more fine-grained semantic distinctions in the <span class="plname">Lava</span>
      language. The latter, in turn, enable more detailed consistency checks and
      facilitate the comprehension of the roles that the various <span class="plname">Lava</span>
      entities play in the respective application context. More thorough
      consideration is required, for instance, with respect to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of <a href="doc/html/TwoObjectCategories.htm">state and
            value objects</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of <a href="doc/html/ObjectLifeCycle.htm">object
            creation/initialization/customization and usage</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of <a href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm#inOutParams">input
            and output parameters</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of <a href="doc/html/Unsolved.htm#pointers">constituents
            and acquaintances</a> of objects,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of mandatory and optional <a href="doc/html/dialogs/MemVarBox.htm#mandatory">member
            variables</a> and <a href="doc/html/dialogs/FuncParmBox.htm#mandatory">function
            arguments</a>,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>distinction of <a href="doc/html/Unsolved.htm#loops">recursion and
            quantification</a> as <span class="plname">Lava</span> successors
          to the usual loop constructs,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>meaningful <a href="doc/html/LavaReadability.htm#declNesting">nesting
            of declarations</a> <a href="doc/html/OOanalysis.htm#patternLanguage">*)</a>,</p>

    <p>Before you download the <span class="plname">Lava</span>/<span class="plname">LavaPE</span>
      software (which includes the documentation) you may want to look into the
