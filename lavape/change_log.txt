New or changed features:
=======================

The debugger now displays also the values of function and
operator input and output parameters (and "self") if you stop
on a function/operator call immediately before the body
of the function/operator is entered, and also immediately
after you have stepped out of a function/operator body.

WhatsThis and WhatNext help has been extended.
HowTo help is still missing.

Bug fixes:
=========

Several bugs related to the display and management
of breakpoints in the Lava debugger have been
removed.

A number of minor bugs has been fixed.
