Change Log for Release 0.8.4
============================

New or changed features:
=======================

(1) We have completely rewritten the Lava "callback" support,
    roughly after the model of the "signal/slot" concept of 
		TrollTechs Qt. This is a first step towards an extended
		Lava GUI builder that will support also mainframe windows,
		menus, toolbars and callbacks.

(2) Lava is more portable now. It can be built on the Windows XP,
    Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris (sparc station and x86, g++),
		and Mac OS X.2 platforms. It has been tested, so far,
		on Windows XP, Linux and FreeBSD. Please tell us if it runs
		also on the other platforms (and also if not).

(3) You can now benefit from "precompiled headers" if you use
    the g++ compiler (g++ release 3.4 or higher).


(4) For the Windows platform we have migrated to the
    NullSoft Install System (NSIS).


(5) We have added a method "zombifyRec" (zombify recursively)
    to class "Object" as a further aid for deactivating whole
		collections of objects containing circular forward references.
