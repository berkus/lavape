Change Log for Release 0.9.0
============================

Migration to Qt4:
================

In a big effort, the entire Lava software has been
migrated to Trolltech's Qt4 package; all dependencies
on Qt3 have been removed.

Lava provides complete static initialization checks now
=======================================================

By purely static checks Lava can now make sure already
at programming time that you cannot inadvertently access
uninitialized variables or null objects. This has been
achieved by two new measures: 1. By the new "closed"
attribute for local variables, for the "self" variable
and for input/output parameters of functions/initializers
which prohibits any access to the member variables of
still unfinished objects during their initialization phase,
2. by introducing more strict static checks of optional-to-
mandatory assignments and two related new constructs:

Checking optional-to-mandatory assignments:
==========================================

As a further step towards complete variable
initialization checks LavaPE now enforces already
at programming time that optional variables and
expressions have a non-null value if the latter is
assigned to a mandatory variable.

The new LavaPE release accepts such an assignment
only

a) if the source of the assignment is an (optional)
variable that is checked by an "ifdef" conditional
statement and if the assigment is contained in the
"then" clause of the "ifdef" statement, or

b) if the source of the assignment is an "else"
expression "x else y" where at least one of x or y
is mandatory.

"x else y" checks (at run time) whether x is null;
if yes then the "else" expression yields y, if no then the
expression yields x.

TOC/index of the online help have been migrated to JavaScript
=============================================================

You can view the Lava online help either in Qt assistant by
invoking it from the LavaPE/Lava help menu or by context-
sensitive help (what's this button with lijnks in help text).

As an alternative (but without the search function of the
Qt assistant version) you can open doc/index.htm in any
web browser. The table of contents and the index had been based
on Java so far, which didn't work to our satisfaction.
Now it is based on JavaScript, which seems to work better.

This version can also be accessed from the Lava home page
(http://lavape.sf.net/index.htm) by clicking the (very big
and bold) "Lava Online Documentation" link.

"p:v"-button shows formal parameter names in function calls
===========================================================

Sometimes you would like to know the formal parameter names
("p") in a function call in addition to the actual parameter
values ("v"), since they should/would provide some information
on the meaning of the parameters. The new "p:v" button on the
exec switches toolbar now allows you to show/hide formal
parameter designators in function calls.
