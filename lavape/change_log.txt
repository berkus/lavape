Change Log for Release 0.8.4
============================

New or changed features:
=======================

1.) The Lava software can now be successfully built
on Windows XP, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X.2,
Solaris 9 (Sparc station and x86).

It has been tested successfully on the Windows XP,
Suse Linux 9.2, Fedora Core 3 Linux, and FreeBSD
platforms.

On Mac OS X.2 and Solaris it could not yet be tested,
since the SourceForge Compile Farm hosts don't
allow you to test applications that have a graphical
user interface.

We should therefore appreciate reports on attempts
to build and test the software on the latter platforms.


2.) We have completely re-designed and re-implemented the
Lava callback support in view of the planned extended
GUI programming support.

Callbacks are now treated in close analogy to the
signal/slot/connect/disconnect/emit notions of the
TroolTech Qt GUI programming toolkit. See the
"Callbacks" documentation in the online help.
