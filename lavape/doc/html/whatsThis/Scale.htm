  <h2 align="center">Scale expression</h2>
  <p>Use the <font color="#0000FF"><b>scale</b> </font>expression to &quot;raise&quot; the 
  class of its input object to a more derived class, e.g., the class &quot;double&quot; of 
  the number 3.5 to the class meters (derived from class &quot;double&quot;, say), 
  yielding 3.5 meters.</p>
  <p>This is accomplished essentially by an implicit &quot;copy onto&quot; operation which 
  you could also perform explicitly by using the <a href="Copy.htm">copy 
  statement</a>.</p>
  <p>Using explicit scale units rather than dimensionless numbers provides more 
  type safety and might prevent costly failures of Mars missions caused by 
  faulty computer programs that confuse yards with meters.</p>
  <p><b>See</b> the ScaleUnits.lava sample.</p>
