  <h2 class="c1">Scale expression</h2>

  <p>Use the <span class="style1">scale</span> expression to &quot;raise&quot; the class of its input object to a more derived class, e.g., the class &quot;double&quot; of the number 3.5 to the class meters (derived from class &quot;double&quot;, say), yielding 3.5 meters.</p>

  <p>This is accomplished essentially by an implicit &quot;<span class="style1">copy onto</span>&quot; operation which you could also perform explicitly by using the <a href="Copy.htm">copy statement</a>.</p>

  <p>Using explicit scale units rather than dimensionless numbers provides more type safety and might prevent costly failures of Mars missions caused by faulty computer programs that confuse yards with meters.</p>

  <p><b>See</b> the ScaleUnits.lava sample.</p>
