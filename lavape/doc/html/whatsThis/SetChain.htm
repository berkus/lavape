  <h2 class="c1">Sets and Chains</h2>

  <p><i class="c2">Lava</i> provides two basic container classes &quot;Set&quot; and &quot;Chain&quot; (see the standard include file std.lava), with more or less obvious methods.</p>

  <p>A <i class="c2">Lava</i> Set is actually a &quot;multi-set&quot;: It may contain the same object more than once. (&quot;Count&quot; counts how often an object is contained in the set. For <a href="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">state objects</a> it counts how many <i>identical</i> objects are in the set, for <a href="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">value objects</a> how many set elements have the <i>same value</i>, i.e., the <i>same contents</i>.)</p>

  <p>The type of the set elements is specified by the virtual type ELEMTYPE.<br />
  <br />
  You can use the <span class="style1">foreach</span>, <span class="style1">exists</span> 
      and <span class="style1">select</span> quantifiers to run through and process the elements of a set.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The Chain class is derived from Set and is essentially a doubly-linked list of elements. It gives you more control over the order of elements and the place of insertion/deletion.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Set and Chain elements can be identified through &quot;handles&quot; that may be returned on insertion.</p>

  <p>In quantification constructs <span class="style1">foreach</span>, 
      <span class="style1">exists</span> and <span class="style1">select</span> the handle operator 
      <span class="style1">@</span> may be used to get the handle of an object found by the construct. (The object found is represented by a local variable of the set element type.)</p>

  <p>Sets and Chains, together with quantifiers <span class="style1">foreach</span>, 
      <span class="style1">exists</span> and <span class="style1">select</span>, logical conjunctions and other constructs are the basis for the close integration of <a href="../DatabaseIntegration.htm">database functionality</a> in <i class="c2">Lava</i>.</p>
