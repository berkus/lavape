      Many Irreducible Mini-Methods (<font color="#ff0000">MIMM</font>)</h2>
    <p>Computer programming is a particular kind of <b>problem solving</b>.</p>
    <p>Speaking generally, the essence of a problem is that we want to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>transform given objects or situations into new or modified objects or 
      situations, </li>
      <li>or to find out whether or not&nbsp; a given situation or object has a 
      certain property.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OO programming describes <i>situations</i> by <i>objects</i>; so in the OO 
    context it suffices to talk about objects.</p>
    <p>OO programming describes <i>problem solutions</i> by <i>methods</i>. From the 
    problem-solving perspective the purpose of a method is to produce new 
    objects from existing ones or to query or modify existing objects.</p>
    <p>We solve problems in steps, i.e., by solving a number of <b>lower-level 
    sub-problems</b> in a certain order.</p>
    <p>A method of a class in an OO program describes such a succession of 
    sub-problem solutions.</p>
    <p>Inspection of existing real-world programs shows us that methods are very 
    often a conglomeration of problem solutions on several levels of detail. 
    They do not just describe the solution of the actual, primary problem, but 
    also the solutions of lower-level sub-problems in a way which makes it hard 
    to understand all these and to modify and maintain or to completely replace 
    particular of these partial solutions.</p>
    <p>We conclude that</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ease of program comprehension,</li>
      <li>ease of maintenance,</li>
      <li>ease of adaptability to new requirements,</li>
      <li>and long-term reusability of problem solutions (cf. Dan Bricklin's 
      article on "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bricklin.com/200yearsoftware.htm">Software 
      That Lasts 200 Years</a>")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>can be achieved only if we avoid this conglomeration of problem solutions 
    belonging to several levels of detail. This is what we call</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Object-Oriented Problem Separation (<font color="#ff0000">OOPS</font>)</b></font><font size="5">.</font></p>
    <p align="left">It centers around the idea that</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left">in OO programming, every method should solve only one 
      problem,
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">every problem solution should be described in a separate 
      method of its own,
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">and in particular: clearly identifiable sub-problems 
      should be described in separate methods.
    </p></li></ul>
    <p align="left">Individual methods will become much smaller this way and 
    (hopefully) easier to understand and to modify. Our object classes will 
    consist of</p>

    <hr>
    <br>
    <p align="left">Decomposition of programs into many small methods is a 
    common programming idiom in object-oriented languages.<font color="#ff0000"><b> </b></font>
    The above considerations show how this decomposition can be motivated in 
    terms of "object-oriented problem separation". But <font color="#ff0000"><b>
    OOPS</b></font><b>:</b><font color="#ff0000"><b>MIMM</b></font> raises a number of 
    obvious questions:</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left"><b>A) Doesn't <font color="#ff0000">OOPS</font>:<font color="#ff0000">MIMM</font> 
    just transform the problem of bloated and conglomerated methods into a 
    problem of bloated and conglomerated classes?</b></p>
    <p align="left">In <b><i><font color="#ff0000">Lava</font></i></b> we have 
    several ways to avoid this, fortunately:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <p align="left">In many cases it will suffice to hide those "lower-level 
      detail methods" <i>in the implementation</i> of the respective class. 
      Since <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> provides complete 
      <b>separation of class interfaces and class implementations,</b> they are concealed 
      then from the eyes of the interface users and cannot confuse them any 
      longer.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">In other cases it may be justified to associate 
      sub-problem solutions with completely separate object classes in order to 
      adequately deal with these sub-problems. In some of these cases it may be 
      natural to utilize <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font><b>'s 
      support of nested declarations</b> and to nest the corresponding class 
      declarations within the primary class (interface) declaration.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">In a third group of cases it may be more natural to 
      utilize <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font><b>'s support of 
      multiple inheritance</b> and to provide specific base classes of the 
      primary class for dealing with lower-level sub-problems. These base 
      classes would be viewed as "mix ins" or "ingredients" of the primary 
      class.
    </p></li></ol>
      <br><p><b>B) Isn't it too cumbersome to create and manage many 
    mini-methods?</b></p>
    <p align="left">In cases 2 and 3 above, where it is justified to provide 
    separate classes associated with lower-level sub-problems, the programmer 
    will accept the additional effort, since he/she is rewarded by an obviously 
    improved since more transparent program structure.</p>
    <p align="left">The crucial issue with case 1 is that you have to jump from 
    your executable code to a different place in order to declare a new method, 
    and then back to the place in your executable code where you wanted to 
    insert a reference to the new method. In <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>LavaPE</b></i></font> 
    this nuisance is largely mitigated</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <p align="left">by <i><font color="#ff0000"><b>LavaPE</b></font></i>'s 
    consequent support of <b>one-click navigation</b> between declarations, 
    implementations and references,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">by <b>two special shortcut buttons</b> on the toolbar at the 
    top of <a href="EditExec.htm">exec</a> windows. They are visible if you 
    select the <font color="#ff0000">&lt;func&gt;</font> placeholder of a method 
    invocation and allow you to create a new private or exported method (in the 
    implementation or in the interface, respectively) of the call objects 
    (static) class and to insert a reference to the new function for
    <font color="#ff0000">&lt;func&gt;</font>, without the necessity to first find and 
    jump to the declaration or implementation of that class. <br>
    <br>
    If you then want to declare also some input or output parameters for the new 
    method, a single click on <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>LavaPE</b></i></font>'s 
    "Go to declaration" button brings you to the method's declaration where you 
    will add the desired parameters, and another click on the "Return to 
    reference" button will bring you back to the method reference in your 
    executable code.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p align="left"><b>C) What are "clearly identifiable sub-problems"?</b></p>
    <p align="left">This is largely a matter of taste and context. Sub-problems 
    will always be "smaller" in some sense or other.&nbsp; There are some 
    general considerations, nevertheless, that may suggest to factor out certain 
    aspects of a program explicitly as sub-problems and to solve them in 
    separate methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><b>Object classes are problem classes</b>: If a code 
      passage within a method of a class C isn't actually related to objects of 
      class C but to objects of some completely unrelated class or to objects of 
      a sub- or super-class of C then you should consider to transform the code 
      passage into a method of that other class.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left"><b>Sub-objects raise sub-problems</b>: Construction of 
      sub-objects (= initialization of member variables) should, as a rule, be 
      factored out. It will mostly be better to initialize member variables on a 
      separate, lower level of detail. This is even <b>enforced</b> in
      <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>: Within an
      <a href="ObjectLifeCycle.htm#initializer">initializer</a> of a
      <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> class, a value must be 
      assigned to <i>every</i> non-optional member variable, and you cannot pass 
      an object as a method parameter or call a method of the object before the 
      object has been completely initialized.<br>
      <br>
      This "single-shot" initialization within the initializers of a class is 
      surely one of the most restrictive (and experimental) features of
      <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> which forces the 
      programmer to construct complex objects (for instance tree structures) in 
      a much more disciplined way in a single pass, but, together with
      <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>LavaPE</b></i></font>'s&nbsp; rigorous 
      initialization checks for local variables, it promises to prevent most of 
      the very frequent "missing initialization" errors that would cause hard to 
      analyze crashes in other programming languages. (In some cases you need a way to
        <a href="MultiPhaseRecIni.htm">collectively or recursively initialize</a> 
        several objects that point to each other. This is accomplished by the
        <span class="style1"><a href="MultiPhaseRecIni.htm">initialize</a></span> clause of the declare 
        construct.<br>
      <br>
      Note the <a href="TwoObjectCategories.htm">distinction</a> between 
      variable "state objects" in <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      that can be modified at any time, and immutable "value objects" that 
      cannot be changed any more after they have left the <font color="#0000ff">
      <b>new</b></font> expression. Single-shot initialization applies also to 
      state objects, and it wouldn't comply with the spirit of
      <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> if you would abuse state 
      objects only to circumvent the single-shot initialization discipline.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left"><b>Case distinctions may induce sub-problem distinctions</b>: 
      Deeply nested case distinctions as well as long and complex branches will 
      often impede program comprehension to an unacceptable degree. Both should 
      be avoided by shifting long branches and nested distinctions into separate 
      methods.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left"><b>Big tasks may call for a subdivision into major 
      "milestones"</b>: The subdivision may be desirable for various reasons and 
      will often be somewhat arbitrary. It may, e.g., be motivated by the 
      assignment of distinct work items to different people, and/or by arguments 
      concerning the relative stability of certain desirable intermediate goals, 
      or just by clarity/transparency/comprehensibility arguments.<br>
      <br>
      The milestones correspond to input and output parameters of specific 
      methods which describe how we can get from the initial state or from one 
      or several milestones to one or several dependent milestones.
    </p></li></ul>
    <p align="left">If you exploit all these possibilities of method / 
    sub-problem factoring you will arrive at a class structure with <b>
    mini-methods</b> that are in this sense <b>irreducible</b>: </p>
    <p align="center"><b>MIMM</b> =<b> M</b>any <b>I</b>rreducible <b>M</b>ini-<b>M</b>ethods.</p>

        <tbody><tr>
          <td width="100%">
          <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">The MIMM notion doesn't 
          have a strictly formal definition but shall encourage the programmers

      </center>
    </div>
    <p align="left">Some more general recommendations may help to further improve the 
    comprehensibility of programs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left">In any case, you should create a separate new method for 
      some code passage only if you can find a succinct, suggestive, 
      unmistakable name for it, or else it will be of limited value only. 
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">Don't hesitate to use long, composite names, if necessary 
      to achieve this goal.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">Use comments in method declarations to explain the essence 
      of the methods.
      </p></li><li>
      <p align="left">Use <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      preconditions, postconditions and invariants ("<a href="DBC.htm">Design By 
      Contract</a>") to characterize the semantics and the implementation 
      restrictions of methods more formally.
    </p></li></ul>
    <p align="left"><b>D) Isn't it too inefficient to invoke many mini-methods 
    instead of using inline code?</b></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> is an 
    interpreted programming language and optimization isn't one of our primary 
    concerns at present. But principally we think that the overhead of 
    mini-method invocations could be avoided in most cases by automatic<span lang="de"> 
    inlining and automatic</span> 
    recognition of <b>tail recursion</b> by the <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
    interpreter (or a future <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
    compiler) which would then be replaced by an internal loop execution 
    automatically.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Speaking of loops:</b> The semantics of traditional loops 
    in programming languages is heterogeneous: Partly they are an optimized way 
    to express tail recursion, partly their semantics would be expressed in 
    mathematical terms by quantifiers ranging over finite sets. In contrast to 
    this, <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> prefers to
    <a href="RepetComputSamples.htm">abandon traditional loops</a><span lang="de">,</span> to 
    explicitly provide quantifiers ranging over finite sets, and to use 
    recursive functions where appropriate. This is another "built-in" measure in
    <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>, beyond the above-mentioned 
    features, to promote the <font color="#ff0000"><b>OOPS:MIMM</b></font> 
    programming discipline.</p>
