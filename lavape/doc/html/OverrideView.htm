    <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Using the override view</H2>
    
    <p>If you would like to derive a new interface or package from an existing
    one you perform the following three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the &quot;New interface&quot; button 
      <IMG SRC="../images/NewItf.png" ALT="Interface" ALIGN="middle" width="23" height="22">
        or &quot;New package&quot; button 
      <IMG SRC="../images/Package.png" ALT="Package" ALIGN="middle" width="21" height="20">,
        respectively, on the declaration bar and fill in the little form that is
        popped up then. You may in particular specify one or several parent
        interfaces or packages whose features and virtual types your new
        interface or package shall inherit. </li>
      <li>Subsequently you may override the inherited features or virtual types:
        Select the new interface/package in the declaration tree and click the
        &quot;Show overridables&quot; button <B>
      <IMG SRC="../images/Derive.png" ALT="Open override view" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16"></B>.
        This opens the &quot;override view&quot; in the right-hand part of the
        tree view window. The override view depicts the entire heritage of the
        new Interface/package and indicates from which base interface/package
        the respective feature or VT originates. You may then select individual
        features or virtual types (or several at once, using the Shift or
        Control buttons in the usual way)&nbsp; and cause them to be overridden
        in the new interface or package by clicking the &quot;Override&quot;
        button <B>
      <IMG SRC="../images/Override.png" ALT="Override feature or VT" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18"></B>.
        The overridden features/VTs appear as parts of the new interface/package
        thereafter, and you may open their respective property sheets (using
        double-click or <B>
      <IMG SRC="../images/Spectacles.png" ALT="Open property sheet" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="20"></B>)
        in order to actually&nbsp; modify their properties.</li>
      <li>Add new features or VTs to the new interface, or new VTs,&nbsp;
        interfaces, or nested packages to the new package, if required.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(The order in which you add and override features, VTs, etc. doesn't
    matter, of course.)</p>
