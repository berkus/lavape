  <h2 class="c1">Advantages of <span class="style1"><strong>Visual Basic</strong></span></h2>

  <p>There is quite a number of reasons for the enormous success of 
      <span class="style1"><strong>Visual Basic</strong></span> (<span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span>):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The structure of the Basic programming language is very simple, particularly as to the executable code.<br /></li>

    <li><span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span> is not only a language but primarily an integrated, interactive development environment (&quot;IDE&quot;).<br /></li>

    <li>The <span class="style1"><strong>VB-IDE</strong></span> has been highly optimized to support rapid application development (&quot;<i><strong>RAD</strong></i>&quot;). It is particularly easy to develop graphical user interfaces and to connect them to handler functions provided by the application.<br /></li>

    <li>The graphical user interface of the <span class="style1"><strong>VB-IDE</strong></span> provides intuitively appealing views for the management of the program structure in the large and the various types of entities (classes, modules, procedures, forms, ...).<br /></li>

    <li><span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span> provides a comprehensive interactive and context-sensitive online help system.<br /></li>

    <li>When editing program texts the &quot;IntelliSense&quot; technology informs you in a little popup window about the types of constructs that may be entered at the current cursor location.<br /></li>

    <li><span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span> is a component integration language which is attuned to Microsoft&#39;s Component Object Model (&quot;<span 
            class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span>&quot;).<br /></li>

    <li><span class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span> components can be written in different languages and then inegrated using 
        <span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span>.<br /></li>

    <li>Interfaces of <span class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span> components can be easily called remotely via Distributed 
        <span class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span> (&quot;<span class="style1"><strong>DCOM</strong></span>&quot;), which makes it easy to construct distributed applications.<br /></li>

    <li><span class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span> components can be embedded in / linked to your application&#39;s user interface and also in/to stored documents (Object Linking and Embedding &quot;<span 
            class="style1"><strong>OLE</strong></span>&quot;, &quot;Compound Documents&quot;).<br /></li>

    <li>There is a wealth of readily available <span class="style1"><strong>COM</strong></span> components for many different purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Nevertheless, we are convinced that there remain many problems that have not been addressed at all by 
      <span class="style1"><strong>Java</strong></span>, <span class="style1"><strong>VB</strong></span>, and other languages or that havn&#39;t found a really satisfactory solution so far.</p>
