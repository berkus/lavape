    <H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><b>What about <i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i> 
    and UML?</b></H2>
    
    <p>Because of the <b>incremental</b> and the uncompromising <b>
    point-and-click</b> style of <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
    programming and because of the <b>ease of renaming and rearrangement</b> 
    operations we believe that <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
    may also be used already in the early (analysis and&nbsp; design) stages of 
    application development, which seem to be dominated by UML tools presently.</p>
    <p>E.g., the typical UML use case &quot;customer opens new bank account&quot; could 
    also be described by three <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
    classes <i>Bank</i>, <i>Customer</i>, <i>Account</i>, and a method <i>
    openAccount</i> of <i>Bank</i>, whose declarations could be established in 
    the twinkling of an eye by just a few point-and-click operations. In this 
    stage, the classes would not yet have any attributes or methods, except 
    for <i>Bank</i>, which would have a method <i>openAccount</i>, but the 
    latter would not yet have any formal parameters.</p>
    <p>The main advantage of using <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
    from the beginning is that you can fill in ever more details in a quite 
    incremental way just as they come into your mind. For instance, if you 
    recognize that <i>openAccount</i> should have an input parameter of type <i>
    Customer</i> and an output parameter of type <i>Account</i> then you can add 
    these details easily and immediately in <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b>, 
    while in UML you would be forced to first translate your use cases into a 
    class diagram before you can specify method parameters.</p>
    <p>Another recognition is that graphical representations would tend to grow 
    very soon beyond the margins of a sheet of paper or a screen, thus 
    compromising ease of understanding and editing.</p>
    <p>So our conclusion and our present working hypothesis is that you should 
    have a single, compact, primary language like <b><i><font color="#FF0000">
    Lava</font></i></b> that supports seamless, consistent, incremental 
    development from analysis over design up to implementation.</p>
    <p>Without any doubt, you would like to produce additional graphic 
    representations of selected, particular aspects of your system or 
    application in various ways.</p>
    <p>The second part of our working hypothesis now is that these additional 
    graphical (or other) representations should be produced in an automatic or 
    semi-automatic way from the complete and more compact primary representation 
    as a <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> program, just like many 
    existing programming environments are already able to produce class diagrams 
    or call graphs from source code. As a by-product, this would also make it 
    easy to keep these derived secondary, for instance graphic, representations 
    consistent with your primary code at all times.</p>
    <p>The <b><a href="FAQWhoTakeLook.htm#AST">AST-nature</a></b> of the 
    internal representation of <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
    programs should greatly facilitate the generation of such derived, secondary 
    representations of <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> programs, 
    and these would be very welcome supplements to the existing <b><i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> programming environment.</p>
