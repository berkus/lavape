  <h2 class="c1">A type is either virtual or non-virtual</h2>

  <h3>Sample file</h3>

  <p>Please open <strong>IsSelfVirtual.lava</strong> in <strong class="c2">LavaPE</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Topic</h3>

  <p>Motivation of <a href="PatternsFrameworks.htm#VTandNonVT">rule 9</a> in our section on <em class="c3">Lava</em> support for <a href="PatternsFrameworks.htm">genericity, design patterns, and frameworks</a>, which reads:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If a class <em>A</em> is the value of a virtual type <em>V</em> then <em>A</em> cannot be referenced directly at any place where <em>V</em> is visible. It can only be referenced indirectly by references to <em>V</em> in these places. If A1 is derived from A within the same pattern, then A1 cannot be referenced directly, either.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Roughly spoken, the reason for this rule is that a type cannot be used as a virtual and as a non-virtual type at the same time within the containing pattern, similarly as in <em class="c3">C++</em> a member function of a class cannot be virtual and non-virtual at the same time.</p>

  <p>In the <strong class="c2">C++</strong> case it would not be clear otherwise whether a concrete invocation of that function should be executed as a virtual or as a non-virtual call.</p>

  <p>In <em class="c3">Lava</em>, without the above rule it would not be clear at check time (but only at run time) whether the type of the special variable <em>self</em> is virtual or non-virtual. As a consequence, a <em>static</em> type check would not be possible in important cases, viz. if <em>self</em> occurs on the right-hand side of assignments or as an input parameter of a function call. In more detail:</p>

  <p>Assume that a member function <em>f</em> of a <strong class="c2">Lava</strong> class <em>A</em> is called with a &quot;call variable&quot; <em>c</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
<span class="style1">call</span> c.f(...)
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and that <em>A</em> is the value of some virtual type <em>vt</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;vt&gt; = A
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now if <em>self</em> is assigned to some variable within <em>f</em> then we ought to know whether the type of <em>self</em> is virtual or not, in order to apply the <a href="TypeSafety.htm#compatibility">type compatibility rules</a> in our section on &quot;<a href="TypeSafety.htm">Static type-safety of <em class="c3">Lava</em></a> &quot;.</p>

  <p>The type of <em>self</em> apparently will comply with the type of <em>c</em>. The latter isn&#39;t known, however, when the body of <em>f</em> is checked, rather it is known only at run time. If we could choose to declare <em>c</em> as being of the virtual type <em>&lt;vt&gt;</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;vt&gt; c;
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>or also as being of the concrete type <em>A</em>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
A c;
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>then we couldn&#39;t decide at check time whether the type of <em>self</em> is virtual or not. Rule 9 excludes the second case and this way enables a static type check by removing this ambiguity.</p>

  <h3>Where to look and what to do</h3>
