<H2 align=center>Member variable property sheet</H2>
<H3>Name</H3>
<P>The name of a function parameter may contain only letters, digits, and "_". 
The first character must not be a digit.</P>
<H3>Enable renaming</H3>
<P>You may change the names of functions, member variables and virtual types 
when you override them in a derived interface or pattern (for instance in order 
to resolve name collisions in cases of multiple inheritance). They inherit the 
names of the base versions by default (and their name is changed accordingly if 
the inherited base name is changed). Check this check-box if you would like to 
assign a different name (which will not be changed then if the base name is 
changed).</P>
<H3>Select type of member variable</H3>
<P>The type of the member variable may be selected from the combo-boxes "Basic 
types" and "Other types". "Basic types" lists all interfaces whose declaration 
is contained in the basic include file <I>std.lava</I>. If you don't explicitly 
select a type for a new member variable then its type will be <I>String</I>.</P>
<H3>Kind of reference</H3>
<P>This attribute enables us to distinguish <A 
href="../PointersRefCounts.htm#refTypes">three kinds of references</A> to other 
objects: <I>Constituents</I>, <I>acquaintances</I>, and <I>reverse</I> (back or 
up) links. Constituents <I>belong</I> to the current object, acquaintances 
are<I> pointers to independent objects</I>, and reverse links are 
<I>auxiliary</I> back or up pointers that are required to facilitate automatic 
storage management by reference counts.</P>
<H3>Object category</H3>
<P>The <A href="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">object category</A> of a member 
variable may be <I>value object</I> (default) or <I>state object</I>.</P>
<H3>Protected</H3>
<P>A <A href="../ProtectedFriend.htm">protected</A> member variable can be 
accessed only by functions contained in the implementation of the present or a 
derived interface.</P>
<H3>Read-only</H3>
<P>A read-only member variable <I>xy</I> of some object can be assigned a value 
only "from inside the object" via the path <I>self.xy</I>, i.e., from within 
functions belonging to the current interface or its implementation. It is 
write-protected against access "from outside".</P>
<H3>Copy on access</H3>
<P>The effect of this attribute is that the respective member object remains 
<I>isolated</I> from the outside world. Every read access delivers a copy of the 
object (that may the manipulated without affecting the original object), every 
write access assigns a copy to the corresponding member variable (that will not 
be affected by subsequent modifications of the write input object).</P>
<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P>This attribute is enabled only if the member variable is accessed via set/get 
functions (see next paragraph). It allows you to defer the implementation of the 
set/get functions to a derived interface: The set/get functions are 
abstract.</P>
<H3>Access via set/get functions</H3>
<P>If a member variable <I>xy</I> has this property then <A 
href="../Unsolved.htm#setGetFunctions">set/get functions</A> are generated for 
it in the implementation of the containing interface. Every read or write access 
to the variable is redirected implicitly through these get/set functions. Only 
these set/get functions themselves may directly access the variable. In this way 
you can supervise every access attempt to the variable and, by properly 
modifying the default set/get functions, achieve additional side effects or 
perform access permission checks.</P>
<H3><a name="consumable"></a>Consumable</H3>
<P><I>Consumable</I> member variables are used for <A 
href="../Transactions.htm#producerConsumer">producer/consumer 
synchronization</A> in <B><I><FONT color=#ff0000>Lava</FONT></I></B>.</P>
<H3>Mode</H3>
<P>The mode of a member variable may be <I><A 
name=mandatory></A></I><B>mandatory</B> (default), <B>optional</B>, or 
<B>placeholder</B>. If <I>optional</I>, the parameter may assume the special 
<I>null value</I> Ø ("undefined"). <I>Placeholder</I> members cannot be accessed 
at all. They are used in <A href="../EditForm.htm">forms</A> to describe fields 
that are to be <I>filled in</I> only in a later step by some other person, 
although they are <I>visible</I> from the beginning.</P>
