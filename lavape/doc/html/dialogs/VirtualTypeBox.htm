    <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Virtual type property sheet</H2>
    
    <H3>Name</H3>
    
    <P>The name of a virtual type (or &quot;<A HREF="../PatternsFrameworks.htm">pattern</A>
      parameter&quot;) may contain only letters, digits, and &quot;_&quot;. The
      first character must not be a digit.</P>
    
    <H3>Enable renaming</H3>
    
    <p>You may change the names of functions, member variables and virtual types
    when you override them in a derived interface or pattern (for instance in
    order to resolve name collisions in cases of multiple inheritance). They
    inherit the names of the base versions by default (and their name is changed
    accordingly if the inherited base name is changed). Check this check-box if
    you would like to assign a different name (which will not be changed then if
    the base name is changed).</p>
    
    <H3>Select value type of VT</H3>
    
    <P>If a virtual type is not abstract then you must specify an existing type
      as its value. This may be a concrete type or may again be virtual and may
      be selected from the combo-boxes &quot;Basic interfaces&quot; and &quot;Other
      interfaces&quot;. &quot;Basic interfaces&quot; lists all interfaces whose
      declaration is contained in the basic include file <I>std.lava</I>. </P>
    <HR>
    
    <H3>Remove overrides</H3>
    
    <P>Transforms an <A HREF="../OverrideView.htm">overridden</A> virtual type
      into a non-overridden virtual type, as if it had been newly declared in the
      containing pattern.</P>
    
    <!--H3>Final</H3>
    
    <P>A <A HREF="../TypeSafety.htm#compatibility">final virtual type</A>
      may not be overridden when overriding the containing pattern. This may be
      required if a variable whose type is the current VT occurs on the target
      side of an assignment anywhere.</P> -->
    
    <H3>Abstract</H3>
    
    <P>A virtual type (pattern parameter) of a package or of a
      <A HREF="InterfaceBox.htm#creatable">non-creatable</A> interface may be
      abstract. I.e., the specification of a value type for this pattern
      parameter is deferred to a derived pattern. For an abstract virtual type
      you may also defer the decision upon the
      <A HREF="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">object category</A> until it is
      overridden by a non-abstract virtual type in a derived pattern. See next
      paragraph.</P>
    
    <H3>Define<span lang="de">s</span> object category</H3>
    
    <P>A virtual type may or may not determine the
      <A HREF="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">object category</A> of all objects
      declared with this VT.</P>
    
    <H3>Object category</H3>
    
    <P>If you have decided that the virtual type shall determine the
      <A HREF="../TwoObjectCategories.htm">object category</A> of all objects
      declared with this VT then you must select this category here.</P>
    
    <h3>Kind of element reference</h3>
    
    <P>If this VT defines the type of the elements of a set, chain, or array 
    then you may specify whether the elements are treated as
    <a href="../PointersRefCounts.htm#refTypes">constituents, acquaintances or 
    reverse links</a>.</P>
