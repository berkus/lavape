    <h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Who might be interested in <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>
    Lava</b></i></font>?</h2>
    
    <p ALIGN="left">To give yourself an answer to this question you should take 
    the following facts into account:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> is an experimental 
      programming language whose primary purpose is to demonstrate the 
      superiority of <b>structure editing tools</b>, in combination with a 
      number of <b>advanced language features</b> that together may help us to 
      reduce the complexity of application programming and to considerably&nbsp; 
      increase the productivity of programmers in this way:<ul>
        <li>Minimum language learning effort by using structure editors rather 
        than text editors.</li>
        <li>Ease of program editing by point-and-click operations; text entry 
        only for comments, constants and new identifiers.</li>
        <li>No syntactic errors; other formal errors are either prevented, 
        likewise, or reported immediately at the moment when they occur.</li>
        <li><a href="FAQWhyAnotherPL.htm">Improved object, component, genericity 
        and other concepts</a> that are at least worth to be investigated and 
        tried out in an experimental language like <b><i><font color="#FF0000">
        Lava</font></i></b> .</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> development is 
      still in an early state; <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
      cannot yet be used for serious software production projects. But for the 
      same reason <b>the <i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i> development is 
      still open</b> and can still be influenced by people who are interested in 
      the general approach of the <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
      project and who would like to contribute to its further development and 
      refinement. For instance:</li>
      <li><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><a name="AST"></a>Lava</font></i></b> lends itself as a 
      test-bed for experimenting with new methods of program analysis and 
      program synthesis, program transformation and generative programming, 
      since a <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> program is 
      constructed directly as a kind of <b>Abstract Syntax Tree</b> (AST); it is 
      stored as a serialized AST, and it is interpreted as an AST by the <b><i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> interpreter. So you need not 
      invest into a compiler and apply modifications to it if you are interested 
      in the above-mentioned topics but you can immediately use the AST 
      representation of <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
      programs.<br/>
      <br/>
      A particular kind of program transformation or code generation would be 
      the generation of graphical abstractions of existing <b><i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> programs, for instance all kinds 
      of <b><a href="FAQUML.htm">UML diagrams</a></b> that might be useful to 
      illustrate specific aspects of a <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> 
      program. These would be very welcome supplements to our existing <b><i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> programming environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Taking all this into account, a short answer to the above question could 
    be: </p>
    <p><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i> might be of interest </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>to people who are generally <b>interested in the further development 
      of programming languages</b>, particularly of object-oriented languages 
      with support for components and design patterns,</li>
      <li>to people who appreciate the principle approach of <b><i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> and would like to influence its 
      further development, or to <b>contribute additional features</b>, or to work on 
      features whose implementation is still missing, or to <b>port <i>
      <font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i>/<i><font color="#FF0000">LavaPE</font></i></b> 
      to other platforms,</li>
      <li>to people who <b>teach object-oriented programming</b> and who would like to 
      benefit from the advantages mentioned in 1. above. The current state of <b>
      <i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> should suffice for small 
      sample programs, and we would be very happy if remaining deficiencies of
      <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i></b> or its implementation 
      would be revealed this way.</li>
    </ul>
