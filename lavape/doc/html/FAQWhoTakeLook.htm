  <h2 class="c2">Who might be interested in <em class="c1">Lava</em>?</h2>

  <p class="c3">To give yourself an answer to this question you should take the following facts into account:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> is an experimental programming language whose primary purpose is to demonstrate the superiority of <strong>structure editing tools</strong>, in combination with a number of <strong>advanced language features</strong> that together may help us to reduce the complexity of application programming and to considerably increase the productivity of programmers in this way:

      <ul>
        <li>Minimum language learning effort by using structure editors rather than text editors.</li>

        <li>Ease of program editing by point-and-click operations; text entry only for comments, constants and new identifiers.</li>

        <li>No syntactic errors; other formal errors are either prevented, likewise, or reported immediately at the moment when they occur.</li>

        <li><a href="FAQWhyAnotherPL.htm">Improved object, component, genericity and other concepts</a> that are at least worth to be investigated and tried out in an experimental language like <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> .</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> development is still in an early state; <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> cannot yet be used for serious software production projects. But for the same reason <strong>the <em>Lava</em> development is still open</strong> and can still be influenced by people who are interested in the general approach of the <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> project and who would like to contribute to its further development and refinement. For instance:</li>

    <li><strong class="c4"><a id="AST"></a>Lava</strong> lends itself as a test-bed for experimenting with new methods of program analysis and program synthesis, program transformation and generative programming, since a <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> program is constructed directly as a kind of <strong>Abstract Syntax Tree</strong> (AST); it is stored as a serialized AST, and it is interpreted as an AST by the <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> interpreter. So you need not invest into a compiler and apply modifications to it if you are interested in the above-mentioned topics but you can immediately use the AST representation of <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> programs.<br />
    <br />
    A particular kind of program transformation or code generation would be the generation of graphical abstractions of existing <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> programs, for instance all kinds of <strong><a href="FAQUML.htm">UML diagrams</a></strong> that might be useful to illustrate specific aspects of a <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> program. These would be very welcome supplements to our existing <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> programming environment.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Taking all this into account, a short answer to the above question could be:</p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="style1">Lava</span> might be of interest</p>

  <ul>
    <li>to people who are generally <strong>interested in the further development of programming languages</strong>, particularly of object-oriented languages with support for components and design patterns,</li>

    <li>to people who appreciate the principle approach of <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> and would like to influence its further development, or to <strong>contribute additional features</strong>, or to work on features whose implementation is still missing, or to <strong>port 
        <span class="style1">Lava</span>/<span class="style1">LavaPE</span></strong> to other platforms,</li>

    <li>to people who <strong>teach object-oriented programming</strong> and who would like to benefit from the advantages mentioned in 1. above. The current state of <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> should suffice for small sample programs, and we would be very happy if remaining deficiencies of <strong class="c4">Lava</strong> or its implementation would be revealed this way.</li>
  </ul>
