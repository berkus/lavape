  <h2 class="c3"><span class="c1">Advantages of</span> <span class="c2">Java</span></h2>

  <p><strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> is a clever combination of features that have been taken from older languages and adapted to the needs of <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="c4">basic object-orientation and many syntactic features from <strong><span class="c2">C++</span></strong>,</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c4">interfaces (as opposed to implementations) from <strong><span class="c2">Modula-2</span></strong>, <strong><span class="c2">Ada</span></strong>, <strong><span class="c2">IDL</span></strong> (<span class="c1">used</span> <strong><span class="c2">in DCE</span></strong>, <strong><span class="c2">COM</span></strong>, <strong><span class="c5">CORBA</span></strong>),</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c4">&quot;byte code&quot; / &quot;virtual machine&quot; from <strong><span class="c2">Pascal</span></strong> P-code,</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c4">absence of an explicit pointer notion from <strong><span class="c2">Oberon</span></strong>, ...</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c4">garbage collection from <strong><span class="c2">LISP</span></strong>/<strong><span class="c2">Smalltalk</span></strong>/<strong><span class="c5">Oberon</span></strong>/...,</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c4">threads from existing <strong><span class="c2">C</span></strong>/<strong><span class="c2">C++</span></strong> libraries ...,</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>. . .</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> is easier to use than <strong><span class="c2">C++</span></strong>, and above all: it is portable, WEB-oriented, and provides an ever growing wealth of class libraries for ever new application domains.</p>

  <p>Last but not least, a clever marketing strategy has prepared the ground for <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong>&#39;s extraordinary success: Sun Microsystems has thrown it on the market in a rather early stage, even though for certain basic features, like event handling, a satisfactory final solution had not yet been found . (Event handling has been revised in <strong><span class="c5">JDK1.1</span></strong>, and Microsoft has offered still another solution in <strong><span class="c2">J++</span></strong>. <strong><span class="c2">Lava</span></strong> provides a fourth solution for event handling since we have not been content with any of the three <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> solutions.)</p>

  <p>The combination of features that <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> has adopted from older languages makes <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> a very useable and useful language.</p>

  <p>But there remain many problems that havn&#39;t been addressed at all by <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> and older languages, or that havn&#39;t found a really satisfactory solution, and therefore we believe that <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong> isn&#39;t the &quot;ultimate programming language&quot; after which it makes no sense to reflect upon better solutions.</p>

  <p>Particularly the enormous popularity of the <strong><span class="c2">Visual Basic</span></strong> programming environment (in spite of the antediluvian character of the <strong><span class="c2">Basic</span></strong> language and in spite of the existence of <strong><span class="c2">Java</span></strong>) proves that there is more behind the success of a language than its abstract conceptual structure, its portability, or the wealth of useful libraries that are available for it.</p>
