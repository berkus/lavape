  <h2 class="c1">Planned enhancements, desirable contributions</h2>

  <p class="c2"><a href="FAQLavaFuture.htm">Desirable contributions</a></p>

  <p>The entire <strong class="c3">Lava</strong> development is presently carried out by two persons and can therefore provide only the most basic functionality of a programming environment in order to demonstrate the central ideas behind <strong class="c3">Lava</strong>, and it is clear that we must continue to work on these basic features of <strong class="c3">Lava</strong>/<strong class="c3">LavaPE</strong>.</p>

  <p>On the other hand we can already now identify quite a number of less central but really necessary or highly desirable features that could be handled by more autonomous, e.g. &quot;remote&quot;, contributors. Some of these are conceivable as topics of master / diploma / PhD theses, and we would offer to supervise the respective work. But we would also be glad if we could find cooperation partners who are interested in the <strong class="c3">Lava</strong> development and willing to contribute minor or major components to this development.</p>

  <p>The latter is presently done in <em class="c4">C++</em> using Microsoft Developer Studio under Windows XP.</p>
