  <h2 class="c1">Planned enhancements, desirable contributions</h2>

  <p class="c2"><a href="FAQLavaFuture.htm">Desirable contributions</a></p>

  <p>The entire <b class="c3">Lava</b> development is presently carried out by two persons and can therefore provide only the most basic functionality of a programming environment in order to demonstrate the central ideas behind <b class="c3">Lava</b>, and it is clear that we must continue to work on these basic features of <b class="c3">Lava</b>/<b class="c3">LavaPE</b>.</p>

  <p>On the other hand we can already now identify quite a number of less central but really necessary or highly desirable features that could be handled by more autonomous, e.g. &quot;remote&quot;, contributors. Some of these are conceivable as topics of master / diploma / PhD theses, and we would offer to supervise the respective work. But we would also be glad if we could find cooperation partners who are interested in the <b class="c3">Lava</b> development and willing to contribute minor or major components to this development.</p>

  <p>The latter is presently done in <i class="c4">C++</i> using Microsoft Developer Studio under Windows XP.</p>
