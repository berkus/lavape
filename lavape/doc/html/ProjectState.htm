    <P>The entire <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>
      development is presently carried out by two persons and can therefore
      provide only the most basic functionality of a programming environment in
      order to demonstrate the central ideas behind <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>,
      and it is clear that we must continue to work on these basic features of
      <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>/<B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LavaPE</FONT></I></B>.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand we can already now identify quite a number of less
      central but really necessary or highly desirable features that could be
      handled by more autonomous, e.g. &quot;remote&quot;, contributors. Some of
      these are conceivable as topics of master / diploma / PhD theses, and we
      would offer to supervise the respective work. But we would also be glad if
      we could find cooperation partners who are interested in the <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>
      development and willing to contribute minor or major components to this
      development.</P>
    
    <P>The latter is presently done in C++ using Microsoft Developer Studio
      under Windows XP.</P>
