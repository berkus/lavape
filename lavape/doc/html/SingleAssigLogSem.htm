  <h2 class="c2">Single-assignment;<br />
  imperative vs. logical semantics of <b class="c1">Lava</strong> programs</h2>

  <p>We have <a href="Unsolved.htm#singleAssign">defined</a> single-assignment in another section as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At run time, a value may be assigned to a variable only once in every program branch within the scope of the variable.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once a value (or a <em>new</em> value) has been assigned to a variable then after this assignment this variable stands for this value in this same program branch. This allows us (but does not force us) to view a <b class="c1">Lava</strong> variable as a <em>logical variable</em> and an assignment as a <em>logical statement</em> which expresses the <em>requirement</em> that its left-hand side should be identical to its right-hand side.</p>

  <p>The <em>logical semantics</em> considers <b class="c1">Lava</strong> statements as <em>logical statements</em> that are to be <em>verified</em>, or rendered <em>true</em>, in a certain order (from top to bottom). Particularly the &quot;;&quot; separator between statements is interpreted as &quot;logical and&quot; conjunction in this view. Formal parameters of functions are <em>free variables</em>, all other variables are <em>quantified</em> by the unbounded logical quantifier 
      <span class="style1">declare</span> or by the bounded quantifiers 
      <span class="style1">exists</span>, <span class="style1">foreach</span> or the by the set constructor 
      <span class="style1">select</span>. The logical semantics enables us to revise the <a href="Transactions.htm#transact">transaction notion</a> in a quite satisfactory way.</p>

  <p>But you can also continue to apply the traditional imperative semantics and view a <b class="c1">Lava</strong> variable as a <em>container</em> and an assignment as an <em>instruction</em> to put the value of its right-hand side into the container designated by its left-hand side.</p>

  <p>From the <em>imperative</em> point of view <b class="c1">Lava</strong> statements are <em>instructions</em> that are to be <em>executed</em> and &quot;;&quot; means <em>sequential execution</em>. The 
      <span class="style1">declare</span> quantifier is viewed as a traditional declaration statement, the bounded quantifiers 
      <span class="style1">exists</span> and <span class="style1">foreach</span> are viewed as loop constructs, and 
      <span class="style1">select</span> corresponds to the <b class="c1">SQL</strong> select expression.</p>

  <p>Clearly a really precise formal definition of the <b class="c1">Lava</strong> semantics would require much greater efforts. (For further study.)</p>
