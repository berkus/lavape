  <h2 class="c2">Learning <strong class="c1">Lava</strong> by samples</h2>

  <p>We believe that the fastest way to learn a new programming language is to look at a number of small and easily understandable sample programs, each of which illustrates only few characteristic features of the respective language. This is the intention behind the following sections.</p>

  <p>You should first read the section on &quot;<strong><a href="BasicEditing.htm">Basic program editing procedures</a></strong>&quot; for an introduction into the usage of the <strong class="c1">LavaPE</strong> programming environment and its primary views.</p>

  <h3>Please pay attention to the comments contained in all samples:</h3>

  <p>In all samples of the following sections the respective explanatory text is contained in quite normal <strong class="c1">Lava</strong> comments.</p>

  <p>In the HTML representation of <strong class="c1">Lava</strong> programs all comments are visible at all times.</p>

  <p><strong>In the <a href="EditTree.htm">declaration tree view</a> of 
      <span class="style1">LavaPE</span> the nodes that have an associated comment are marked by a little yellow bubble on the right side of their respective icon, for instance</strong> <img src="../images/classint1.png" alt="{short description of image}" width="21" height="15" />. <strong>You must explicitly open the comment window at the bottom of the 
      <span class="style1">LavaPE</span> window by pressing the &quot;Next comment&quot; or &quot;Preceding comment&quot; tool buttons <img src="../images/Comments.png" alt="Show next/preceding comment" width="44" height="22" /> to make the explanations visible, and you may then select a tree item whose icon indicates the availability of a comment in order to display this comment in the comment window.</strong></p>

  <p>In <a href="EditExec.htm">exec views</a> (showing executable code) the comments are displayed directly adjacent to the respective syntactic constructs as leading, trailing, inline or non-inline comments, provided that the &quot;Show/hide comments&quot; tool button <img src="../images/ToggleComments.png" width="22" height="21" alt="img" /> is in &quot;depressed&quot; state (default); you may suppress comments in execs by pressing this button again.</p>
