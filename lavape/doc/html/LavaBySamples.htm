    by samples</H2>
    
    <P>We believe that the fastest way to learn a new programming language is
      to look at a number of small and easily understandable sample programs,
      each of which illustrates only few characteristic features of the
      respective language. This is the intention behind the following sections.</P>
    
    <P>You should first read the section on &quot;<B><A HREF="BasicEditing.htm">Basic program
        editing procedures</A></B>&quot; for an introduction into the usage of
      the <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LavaPE</FONT></I></B> programming
      environment and its primary views.</P>
    
    <H3>Please pay attention to the comments contained in all samples:</H3>
    
    <P>In all samples of the following sections the respective explanatory text
      is contained in quite normal <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>
      comments.</P>
    
    <P>In the HTML representation of <B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lava</FONT></I></B>
      programs all comments are visible at all times.</P>
    
    
<P><B>In the <A HREF="EditTree.htm">declaration tree view</A> of <I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LavaPE</FONT></I> 
  the nodes that have an associated comment are marked by a little yellow bubble 
  on the right side of their respective icon, for instance</B> 
<IMG SRC="../images/classint1.png" ALT="{short description of image}" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE" width="21" height="15">. 
  <B>You must explicitly open the comment window at the bottom of the <I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LavaPE</FONT></I> 
  window by pressing the &quot;Next comment&quot; or &quot;Preceding comment&quot; 
  tool buttons 
<img src="../images/Comments.png" alt="Show next/preceding comment" align="absmiddle" width="44" height="22"> 
  to make the explanations visible, and you may then select a tree item whose 
  icon indicates the availability of a comment in order to display this comment 
  in the comment window.</B></P>
    
    
<P>In <A HREF="EditExec.htm">exec views</A> (showing executable code) the comments 
  are displayed directly adjacent to the respective syntactic constructs as leading, 
  trailing, inline or non-inline comments, provided that the &quot;Show/hide comments&quot; 
  tool button <img src="../images/ToggleComments.png" align="absmiddle" width="22" height="21"> 
  is in &quot;depressed&quot; state (default); you may suppress comments in execs 
  by pressing this button again. </P>
