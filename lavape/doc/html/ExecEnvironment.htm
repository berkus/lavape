  <h2 class="c2">Execution environments of <b class="c1">Lava</b> applications</h2>

  <p>A <b class="c1">Lava</b> file represents an executable program if the first <b class="c1">Lava</b> entity in its top-level package is an <a href="Packages.htm#initiator">initiator</a>. You can execute such a <b class="c1">Lava</b> program, i.e., its first initiator, from <b class="c1">LavaPE</b> by clicking the &quot;Run&quot; button. Alternatively you could start the <b class="c1">Lava</b> interpreter (Lava.exe) and pass the name of an executable <b class="c1">Lava</b> program as a command line parameter to it.</p>

  <p>This way of starting a <b class="c1">Lava</b> program by starting a top-level initiator is appropriate for <b>stand-alone 
      <span class="style1">Lava</span> applications</b> or for programs with a <b>
      <span class="style1">Lava</span> main program</b> that perhaps make use of <b>&quot;foreign-language&quot; <a href="Components.htm">components</a></b> additionally.</p>

  <p>Conversely a <b class="c1">Lava</b> program could be invoked <b>as a component</b> from another <b class="c1">Lava</b> or foreign-language main program or component.</p>

  <p>In any case we have to envisage several ways how such a <b class="c1">Lava</b> program or <b class="c1">Lava</b> component may interact with its environment, and that is what the term &quot;execution environments&quot; is intended to express. The pertinent support available from the underlying operating system will largely decide upon the variety of reasonable execution environments:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A <b>&quot;<span class="style1">Lava</span> console application&quot;</b> might be started from a command line environment and consume/produce nothing else than line mode input/output.</li>

    <li>A <b>&quot;<span class="style1">Lava</span> tabbed window application&quot;</b> may present a Multiple-Document Interface to the user. Several <b class="c1">Lava</b> programs may run concurrently in such an execution environment and open any number of 
        tabs. <b>This is what the current 
        <span class="style1">Lava</span> development aims at as a first step.</b></li>

    <li><b>&quot;<i>Lava</i> SDI applications&quot;</b> presenting a single-program/Single-Document Interface are imaginable as a special case.</li>

    <li><b>Component-based applications</b> with <b class="c1">Lava</b> programs on the client/container or on the component/server side could support various features, for instance, in <b class="c1">Microsoft COM</b> terms: Linking/embedding of user interfaces, compound documents, <b class="c1">ActiveX Documents</b>, <b class="c1">ActiveX Controls</b>, particularly embedding of <b class="c1">Lava</b> objects in WEB pages similar to <b class="c1">Java</b> applets or <b class="c1">ActiveX Controls/Documents</b>, <b class="c1">Automation</b> client or server, drag-and-drop between components, communication through the clipboard, database access through <b class="c1">OLE-DB</b>.</li>

    <li><b class="c1">Lava</b> programs as <b class="c1">CORBA</b> objects/components.</li>
  </ol>
