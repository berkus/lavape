      Introduction</h3>
    <p align="left">
      &quot;Design By Contract&quot; is a trademark of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eiffel.com">
      Interactive Software Engineering</a> referring to special expressive means 
      of the <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font> <span lang="de">&nbsp;</span>language. See, 
      e.g., the equally named section in the
      <a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/online/eiffel50/intro/language/tutorial.pdf">
      Eiffel Tutorial of ISE</a>: In Eiffel you can specify pre- and
      postconditions for methods and invariants for classes, and also 
      some other kinds of assertions.</p>
    <p align="left">
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> provides preconditions, postconditions,&nbsp; invariants, and <font color="#0000FF"><b>assert</b></font> 
      statements, too, with a number of differences, as compared with <i>
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>Eiffel</b></font></i>, that should be 
      noted (see below). </p>
    <p align="left">
      We have used the term &quot;design by contract&quot; in the title because it is 
      well-known in professional circles and because of some 
      basic similarities of the
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> approach with that of
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font>.
      Actually we don't like the term since
      &quot;design by contract&quot; suggests the 
      idea of a precise contract between customer and programmer, in the sense 
      of comprehensive necessary and sufficient conditions for the correctness 
      of method implementations&nbsp; which <b>
      completely</b> specify</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      what the caller of a method should make sure on entry to the method (<b>precondition</b>) 
      and </p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      what the programmer of the method should guarantee on exit from the method 
      (<b>postcondition</b>),</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      while a class <b>invariant</b> is a condition that should be true on every 
      entry to and exit from a (public) method of the class.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">
      Such a comprehensive, complete, formal contract would require the 
      expressive means of a specialized specification language, however, and 
      such expressive means are neither provided by <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>
      Eiffel</i></b></font>, nor by <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Lava</i></b></font>:</p>
    <p align="left">
      In place of &quot;design by contract&quot; we prefer to speak of <b>attached 
      assertions</b> (pre- and postconditions are attached to methods, 
      invariants to classes) and of <b>assertion checking</b>. The term 
      &quot;attached assertions&quot; emphasizes that such an assertion isn't embedded 
      within normal executable code but attached to the 
      declarations/implementations of methods and classes; their execution is 
      triggered by the run time system on specific occasions (entry/exit to/from 
      methods). Checking of attached assertions may also be switched off on demand.</p>
    <p align="left">
      The purpose of such assertions is</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      to provide additional <b>documentation</b> and explanations</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      on the <b>semantics</b> of methods and classes and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      on <b>implementation restrictions and limitations</b> that the user of 
      these classes and methods has to observe.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      to serve as a <b>debugging aid</b>: the assertions provide additional 
      redundant information on methods and classes that (hopefully) will enable 
      early detection of programming errors before they end up in obscure 
      crashes.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left">
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> pre/postconditions and 
      invariants are checked at run time according to the following rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      Preconditions are checked immediately before entry to the corresponding 
      method to which they are attached. The method body is skipped if an 
      exception occurs in the precondition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      Postconditions are checked immediately after the body of the method has 
      been left (if no exception has been thrown by the method body.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      Invariants (including all invariants &quot;inherited&quot; by a class from its 
      direct and indirect base classes) are checked on object creation when the new object leaves the
      <font color="#0000FF"><b>new</b></font> expression, and on entry/exit 
      to/from every public non-read-only method; for read-only methods only on 
      entry (cf. subsection D) of the next section).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p align="left">
      Assertion checking is turned off within assertions to avoid infinite 
      recursions which otherwise could easily occur. (E.g., assertions attached 
      to a method m1 of some class would frequently make use of a method m2 of 
      that class, while the assertions attached to m2 may refer to m1 again, or 
      similarly.)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">
      In addition to the actual checking of pre/postconditions
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> checks also the 
      consistency of these assertions with those of overridden methods: See 
      subsection C) of the next section.</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      Differences between <i><font color="#FF0000">Lava</font></i> and
      <font color="#FF0000"><i>Eiffel</i></font> attached assertions</h3>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b>A) Comprehensiveness of the expressive means</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      In <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font>, assertions are 
      expressed by <b>Boolean expressions</b>, while</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> has considerably more 
      general expressive means, including all kinds of statements, like 
      assignment, branching, and function call statements (with more than one 
      output), comparison statements, and quantifiers. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">
      The only restriction is that a <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      assertion must have the <b><a href="ReadOnly.htm">read-only</a> </b>property, i.e, it must not modify 
      pre-existing objects (= objects that existed already before starting the 
      evaluation of the assertion). The <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      programming environment <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>LavaPE</b></i></font> 
      makes this sure already at programming time.</p>
    <p align="left">
      You should not in this context that executable <font color="#FF0000"><i>
      <b>Lava</b></i></font> statements can be viewed as <b>
      <a href="SingleAssigLogSem.htm">logical statements</a></b>. 
      Execution of a statement means <b>verification</b> and yields the result
      <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font> or <font color="#0000FF"><b>false</b></font> 
      (if no exception is thrown). As a consequence, where other programming 
      languages would use Boolean expressions, for instance in if-conditions,
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> uses quite normal 
      (&quot;read-only&quot; or, as in if-conditions, even &quot;assignment-free&quot;) statements.</p>
    <p align="left">
      Note also that comparisons </p>
    <p align="center">
      &lt;expression&gt; &lt;comparison-operator&gt; &lt;expression&gt;</p>
    <p align="left">
      are <i>statements</i> in <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>, 
      not <i>Boolean expressions</i>.</p>
    <p align="left">
      Like <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font>,
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> provides an &quot;<font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font> 
      &lt;expression&gt;&quot; which allows you to refer to the original value of an 
      expression (on method entry) within postconditions and method bodies. The
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> &quot;<font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font>&quot; 
      expression has a more satisfactory semantics, however (see below).</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b>B) <font color="#FF0000"><i>Lava</i></font> distinguishes semantic and 
      implementation-related assertions</b></h3>
    <p align="left">
      In <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>, declaration and 
      implementation of methods and classes are strictly separated; as an 
      obvious consequence, assertions can be attached to <i>both</i>.</p>
    <p align="left">
      This is in fact highly desirable, since it allows us to adequately express 
      not only &quot;logical&quot; assertions which characterize the actual logic and 
      semantics of classes and methods, but also purely implementation-related 
      assertions which describe restrictions and limitations of the respective 
      implementation.</p>
    <p align="left">
      For instance, if you implement a &quot;table&quot; class on the basis of an array of 
      fixed length then you have an implementation restriction concerning the 
      capacity of the table. This may be perfectly acceptable for the intended 
      application, but it is by no means an inherent semantic restriction of a 
      &quot;table&quot; class. In this case you could attach a quite natural &quot;capacity 
      check&quot; precondition to the implementations of all &quot;table&quot; methods that add 
      a new element to the table.</p>
    <p align="left">
      Moreover, it is desirable to distinguish this kind of 
      &quot;implementation-related&quot; assertions from &quot;semantical assertions&quot; since the 
      &quot;hierarchy correctness checks&quot; of the next section are justified only for 
      the latter and don't make sense for the former.</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b>C) Inheritance: <font color="#FF0000"><i>Lava</i></font> performs  assertion 
      consistency checks at run time</b></h3>
    <p align="left">
      These are also known as &quot;hierarchy correctness checks&quot; in the context of 
      &quot;Behavioral Subtyping&quot;; cf., e.g., <a href="#biblio">[1]</a> and
      <a href="#biblio">[2]</a> below. They make sure that the behavior of 
      derived classes, taking pre- and postconditions into account, should 
      comply with the behavior of base classes. Here are the two 
      basic principles that govern these consistency checks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      If we have a class C1, and a class C2 derived from C1, and a (public) 
      method m in C1 which is overridden in C2, and if m has a precondition pr1 
      in C1and pr2 in C2, and if a concrete invocation of the method (with a 
      call object of&nbsp;class C2) would be 
      admissible according to pr1 then it should also be admissible according to 
      pr2. In other words: If pr1 evaluates to <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font> 
      in the concrete case then pr2 should also evaluate to
      <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font>. This applies also if pr1 is 
      absent (= always <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font>): pr2 must also 
      be always <b><font color="#0000FF">true</font></b> (for instance absent). 
      (If pr2 is absent then pr1 trivially implies pr2.) Roughly spoken:<br>
      <br>
      <b>The precondition of an overriding method should be equivalent to or at 
      most weaker than that of a corresponding overridden method.</b></p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p align="left">
      And for postconditions po1 and po2: If a concrete invocation of the method 
      (with a call object of&nbsp;class C2) is admissible according to preconditions pr1 (and therefore, because of 1. 
      above also pr2) and consequently ensures the validity of postcondition po2 
      then it should also ensure the validity of postcondition po1. In other 
      words: If pr1, pr2 and po2 evaluate to <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font> 
      in the concrete case then po1 should also evaluate to
      <font color="#0000FF"><b>true</b></font>. Roughly spoken:<br>
      <br>
      <b>The postcondition of an overriding method should be equivalent to or at 
      most stronger than that of a corresponding overridden method.</b></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left">
      <b>Note 1</b>: Since <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      supports <a href="SepItfImpl.htm">multiple inheritance</a> a method may 
      override several methods (of several base classes). Then the two 
      consistency rules apply to all these overridden methods.</p>
    <p align="left">
      <b>Note 2:</b> <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> supports
      <a href="PatternsFrameworks.htm">virtual types</a> (= parameter types of 
      classes and packages) and <a href="TypeSafety.htm#substitutableType">
      substitutable types</a>. If a class derivation is induced by the 
      specialization of a virtual type then it may happen that an overridden 
      method cannot be invoked with an object of the derived class. In this case 
      the assertion consistency rules do not apply, since the pre/postconditions 
      of the overridden method generally cannot be evaluated, too.</p>
    <p align="left">
      In contrast to <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>,
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font> <b>does not check the 
      consistency of preconditions</b> of overridden and overriding methods <b>
      but enforces consistency</b> by automatically connecting all these 
      preconditions by a logical OR conjunction. Newer research articles (like <a href="#biblio">[1]</a> and
      <a href="#biblio">[2]</a> below) call this approach into question and 
      recommend a consistency checking approach since automatic ORing may mask a 
      real inconsistency and fail to report it. It may then falsely come to the 
      surface as a postcondition violation which is caused by the fact that the 
      ORed preconditions are too weak to actually ensure the intended 
      postcondition.</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b><font size="4">D) <font color="#FF0000"><i>Lava</i></font> guarantees the read-only 
      property of assertions</font></b></h3>
    <p align="left">
      The evaluation of an assertion should not change the referenced objects or 
      any other &quot;pre-existing&quot; objects, i.e., objects that existed already 
      before the evaluation started. In <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      this is guaranteed owing to the <a href="ReadOnly.htm">read-only</a> 
      property of assertions, which can be checked already at programming time 
      in <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>.</p>
    <p align="left">
      Another nice side effect of the fact that <font color="#FF0000">
      <i><b>Lava</b></i></font> can <i>guarantee</i> the <a href="ReadOnly.htm">
      read-only</a> property of methods: <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> 
      does not have to to check <i>invariants</i> after read-only methods since 
      the latter cannot change any objects that existed already on entry to the 
      method.</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b>E) The &quot;<font color="#0000FF">old</font>&quot; expression has a more 
      satisfactory semantics in <font color="#FF0000"><i>Lava</i></font></b></h3>
    <p align="left">
      Like <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Eiffel</b></i></font>,
      <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font> provides an &quot;<font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font>
      <font color="#FF0000">&lt;expression&gt;</font>&quot; which allows you to refer to the original value of an 
      expression (on method entry) within postconditions and method bodies. The 
      implementation of <font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font> requires to 
      evaluate the <font color="#FF0000">&lt;expression&gt;</font> on method entry and 
      to store a <b>copy </b>of the resulting object for later reference. (The 
      original result object might be modified before it is actually referenced 
      by the respective &quot;<font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font>
      <font color="#FF0000">&lt;expression&gt;</font>&quot;.)</p>
    <p align="left">
      Naturally this raises the question: What is a <b>copy </b>of an object?<b>
      </b>The <i>copy</i> notion calls for a precise answer to the question: <b>
      What belongs to the object?</b> Fortunately, concerning the attributes (or
      <i>member objects</i>) of an object, <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava</b></i></font>
      <a href="Unsolved.htm#pointers">provides a clear distinction</a> between <b>constituents</b> and <b>
      acquaintances</b>. The former (and also constituents of constituents, 
      etc.) <b>belong</b> to the object, while acquaintances (also of nested 
      constituents) just <b>point</b> to independent objects.</p>
    <p align="left">
      Without such a distinction you can provide only a more or less 
      undifferentiated and arbitrary semantics of &quot;<font color="#0000FF"><b>old</b></font>
      <font color="#FF0000">&lt;expression&gt;</font>&quot; which won't reflect the 
      application needs in many cases.</p>
    <h3 align="left">
      <b>F) Visibility of class attributes to clients of methods doesn't require 
      special rules in <font color="#FF0000"><i>Lava</i></font></b></h3>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The
    <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/online/eiffel50/intro/language/tutorial.pdf">
    ISE Eiffel Tutorial</a> states on page 41:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;A requirement on meaningful contracts is that they should be 
    in good faith: satisfiable by an honest partner. This implies a consistency 
    rule: if a routine is exported to a client (either generally or 
    selectively), any feature appearing in its precondition must also be 
    available to that client. Otherwise — for example if the precondition 
    included <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>require </b>
    </font><font COLOR="#0000ff">n</font>&gt;
    </font><font COLOR="#0000ff">0</font>, 
    where <font COLOR="#0000ff">n </font>
    is a secret attribute—the supplier 
    would be making demands that a good-faith client cannot possibly check for.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">
      In <font color="#FF0000"><i><b>Lava </b></i></font>we don't need such 
      special rules since attached assertions in interfaces can only reference 
      class features that are declared in that class interface. (&quot;Private&quot; 
      features, declared in class implementations, can be referenced only from 
      within that implementation and are invisible to the &quot;outside world&quot;, 
      including to the assertions in the corresponding interface.)</p>
