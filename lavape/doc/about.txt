LavaPE 0.8.3

The unusual programming environment
of the object-oriented Lava language

that replaces text editors completely with
structure editors

and supports many modern programming
language features:

  * no syntax errors possible owing to
    structure editing,

  * immediate checking for semantic errors
    after every single editing step,

  * strict separation of class interfaces
    and class implementations,

  * multiple inheritance of interfaces,

  * support of design pattern realization
    by parameterized families of classes
    ("virtual types"),

  * which also renders type casts superfluous,

  * dynamically attached software components

  * "Design by Contract" (TM of ISE Eiffel)
