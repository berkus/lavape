I) Change Log for Release 0.9.1
===============================


A) The LavaPE/Lava GUI is now based on tabbed and splitter widgets
==================================================================

The user interface of the Lava Programming Environment LavaPE
and of the Lava interpreter is no longer based on the MDI (Multiple
Document Interface) concept but on tabbed and splitter widgets, which
promise to allow for more neatly arranged, non-overlapping windows.

The individual tabs can be rearranged by drag-and-drop within
a tabbed widget as well as between different tabbed widgets.
The latter may be arranged horizontally or vertically.


B) Support of Mac OS
====================

The Lava programming environment can now also be built and run
on the Mac OS 10.5 platform. A binary package for Mac OS 10.5
is also available now.


II) Installation of Lava/LavaPE
==============================


A) How to install the Windows binary release of LavaPE
======================================================

Simply launch the downloaded lavape-<rel>-win32-bin.exe file and
follow the instructions of the installer.


B) How to install the Linux binary release of LavaPE
====================================================

Download the lavape-<rel>-linux-bin.tar.bz2 package, move it to
the directory where the "lavape" installation directory is to
reside as a subdirectory, and execute

   tar xjf lavape-<rel>-linux-bin.tar.bz2

in the usual way. In lavape/bin you will find the LavaPE/Lava
executables of the Lava Programming Environment and of the
Lava interpreter, respectively, thereafter. Execute

   ./LavaPE  or ./Lava , resp., to launch them.


How to install the Mac OS 10.5 binary release of LavaPE
=======================================================

Download the lavape-<rel>-macos.dmg package, move it to
the directory where the "lavape" installation directory is to
reside as a subdirectory, and double-click it in the
Mac OS Finder.

   tar xjf lavape-<rel>-linux-bin.tar.bz2

in the usual way. In lavape/bin you will find the LavaPE/Lava
executables of the Lava Programming Environment and of the
Lava interpreter, respectively, thereafter. Execute

   ./LavaPE  or ./Lava , resp., to launch them.


How to install LavaPE from the source distribution on UNIX/Mac OS
=================================================================

Download the compressed tar file lavape-<release>-src.tar.bz2
of the LavaPE source distribution and store it in the parent
directory of the envisaged lavape installation directory.

Uncompress it using the command

   tar xjvf lavape-<release>-src.tar.bz2

You need to have GNU gcc/make and the developer version
of TrollTech/Qt4.

Either you may download Qt4 from
http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/x11 and
build it yourself. In this case you must set the
environment variable QTDIR to point to the Qt-<release>
directory that is created by the build process,
before you build Lava/LavaPE from the sources.

Or, on a Linux box, the software package manager of your
Linux distribution offers you the possibility to download 
and install the Qt4 developer package(s). The Lava
build process will then try to locate the Qt4 include files,
libraries and utility programs automatically (using the
qbin.sh, qincl.sh, qlib.sh, and qsuff.sh shell procedures
in the lavape top-level directory).

Then build the LavaPE executables as follows:

   cd lavape
   make

This will take quite a while. You will find the executables
of the Lava Programming Environment in lavape/bin thereafter:
"LavaPE", "Lava", and "LPC". (The Lava Precompiler "LPC" is needed
only during the build process.)

Go to the lavape/bin directory, launch "./LavaPE", consult the
Online Help, open some sample programs from the lavape/samples
directory and enjoy the unique structure editing features of LavaPE.

You can run the Lava interpreter "Lava" 

1. either by executing "./Lava" in the lavape/bin directory and by
   opening a *.lava or *.ldoc file from the file menu or from the
   file open button, or
   
2. from LavaPE by clicking the "running man" toolbutton, after you
   have activated a view containing the executable code of a
   main program or a declaration tree view that contains a
   main program declaration.

We'd appreciate very much if you would inform
us (e-mail: guenthk@users.sourceforge.net)
about any problems that you have encounterd
during the installation or while using
Lava/LavaPE.

But let us also know if you could successfully
install and use LavaPE. So far, we could not test Lava
on all platforms where we can build it successfully.
